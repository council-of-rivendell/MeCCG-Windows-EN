Gccg modules are installed via packages which in turn can be created 
with the perl script gccg_package with existing content and directives. 

xml/packages.xml contains the directives that are used to build the 
packages, label them with a version and structure them. 

The command "gccg_package b" builds all module packages specified in the 
packages.xml and writes them into build/modules together with 
available.xml that indicates to a downloading client what the repository 
contains with which version. 

The modules in build/modules are supposed to be provided in a repository 
directory on a server for a client to fetch. The client needs the URL of 
the repository added in /xml/installed.xml The command 
"perl gccg_package source add <URL>" does that or it can also be added by 
hand in the installed.xml directly. 

Fetching modules with a client is performed with
perl gccg_package install core client fonts [windows32] [module names]

Note that the client checks versions and skips those that are outdated or
already installed locally.
