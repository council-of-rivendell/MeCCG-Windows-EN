	Generic Collectible Card Game is a
	  multiplayer multiplatform implementation of a card game
	  engine. The card game engine is designed to be of general
	  purpose core for several modules each defining the game specific
	  behaviour. Players download a client for their platform and all
	  modules of interest. After launching the client for one of the
	  games, it connects to the central server of the game
	  chosen. When connected, all aspects of the collecting, trading
	  and playing are availble to the player. <br>
	  Here is a brief summary of features:
	  <ul>
	  <li>Deck editor including import and export from/to a text file. 
	  <li>Fast game play: bureaucracy not implemented (on purpose).
	  <li>1-4 players.
	  <li>You can watch games while not playing yourself.
	  <li>Highly customizable: macros and scripting language included.
	  <li>Servers have a knowledge of several game formats (for example Type 1, Type 1.5, etc. in Mtg). 
	  Own game formats can be defined.
	  <li>Sell cards by determining a price and the number of cards for sale. 
	  Clients can see always the best offer.
