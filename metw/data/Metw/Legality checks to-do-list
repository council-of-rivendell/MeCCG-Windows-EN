# all Elf-lord decks must allow stage cards specific to Elf-lords (e.g. The Elf-king)

# Grinding Ice must be allowed as a hazard as well as a resource

# Dragon-lords must not count as characters but as avatar cards

# allow for everything in the sideboard of a Dragon-lord (hero character are not allowed right now)

#add this cards to limit 0 for Elf-lord aligment
	
*You may not play the following minion resources:
Any cards that is specific to a Balrog, Ringwraith or Sauron Avatar. (would you prefer a list here or can that be done via 
any kind of filer? I could make all cards ringwraith specific
